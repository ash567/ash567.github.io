I am a final year student at Indian Institute of Technolgy Madras (IITM), pursuing a Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) in the <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in">Department of Computer Science and Engineering]</a> at <a href="http://www.iitm.ac.in">IIT Madras</a>. I have almost completed the requirenments of my bachelor's degree and currently working on deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing with my advisor <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/">Professor Mitesh Khapra</a> for my masters degree. Along with that, I was also a teaching assistant for the Computer System Design course at IITM taught by Professor  <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~murthy/">C. Siva Ram Murthy</a>. Currently I am TA for Computer Programming Lab taught by professor  <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~rupesh/">Rupesh Nasre</a>.

Over the years at IITM, I was able complete two internships, one at Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon Universiy (MLD, CMU) where I worked with Professor  <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~katef/">Katerina Fragkiadaki</a> on learning structure and motion from video using deep learning techniques. The second with  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/salilrjoshi/">Salil Joshi</a> at IBM Research Lab on event and entity extraction from huge amount of raw unstructured data using Natural Language Processing Techniques.

Mantra for the month:<br>
तुलसी भरोसे राम के, निर्भय हो के सोए।<br>
अनहोनी होनी नहीं, होनी हो सो होए।।<br>
