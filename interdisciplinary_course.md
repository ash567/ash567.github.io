I have always loved working with well motivated teams. One of my first experience of using technology and developing product started from the very first semester. Working on two separate group projects as a part of an interdisciplinary course titled ‘Concepts in Engineering Design’, our team was able to come up with excellent products to the interesting product requirements thrown at us. The first problem statement required us to count the number of vehicles crossing the Institute gate. With just the high school knowledge of science, we came up with a scalable prototype which could not only meet the problem statement but could also calculate the approximate length and speed of vehicles crossing a gate. For the second project, we had to develop a egg basket. We designed and developed a egg basket using only newspapers, without using any glue or tape, with a capacity of 12 eggs. It was safe enough to protect eggs under adverse circumstances and was subjected to a drop test from 6 feets and compression test with 90 kg weight. It was also chosen to be the best design among all the teams.

Unfortunately, I do not have good pics of the project. But I do have a video, demostrating the working of vehicle counter.
