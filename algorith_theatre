The video demonstrates the working of Algorithm Theatre for Selection Sort.

Algorithm Theatre is a software that provides a simple GUI based application that interactively allows the user to understand the details of some of the standard algorithms in Computer Science. The application demonstrates each step of the algorithm graphically. This application allows the user to first select an algorithm from a list of algorithms. Then the user can directly run the algorithm on the default input or select the input of his/her choice and run it. Then the user sees the working of the algorithm in the real time.

Currently, following algorithms have been implemented:

• Insertion Sort
• Merge Sort
• Quick Sort
• Selection Sort
• Bubble Sort
• Binary Search Tree
• Binary Heap
