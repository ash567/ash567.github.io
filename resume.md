# Resume/CV
--------------------------
I have two versions of my resume! First one is a one page resume, where I list most events of my professional carrear. This resume purposefully do not cover academic detailes to keep it short. The second resume is a two page resume which is a superset of the first resume and tries to include as much academic detail as one can fit within two pages!!<br><br>
One page resume: <a href="documents/resume_ishu_one_page.pdf" target="_blank">[PDF]</a> <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/examples/recreating-business-insiders-cv-of-marissa-mayer-using-altacv/gtqfpbwncfvp#.WgLwlbyWaIY" target="_blank">[Template]</a><br><br>
Two page resume: <a href="documents/resume_ishu_two_page.pdf" target="_blank">[PDF]</a> <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/examples/curriculum-vitae/ztykfkztnqfh#.WgLxIryWaIZ" target="_blank">[Template]</a><br><br>
Both the resume has be typesetted in Latex. Any suggestion on improving the current versions of my resume are more than welcome!
